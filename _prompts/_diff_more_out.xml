Based on the provided codebase diff and the current state of the codebase, no additional files require updates to maintain consistency and integrity. All necessary changes related to the modifications in `app/api/cards/route.ts`, `app/slices/flashcardsSlice.ts`, `app/slices/languageCardsSlice.ts`, and `prisma/schema.prisma` have been appropriately handled within the affected files. Additionally, there are no redundant or obsolete files that need to be deleted or updated beyond those already included in the diff.

```xml
<files_content>
</files_content>
```

If you have specific components or functionalities that interact with the updated `Flashcard` and `LanguageCard` structures, ensure they are designed to handle the newly added optional fields (`word`, `translation`, `example`, `explanation`, `notes`, `lastReviewed`, `status`, `categoryId`, and `userId`). However, based on the current information and the provided codebase, no further modifications are necessary.
